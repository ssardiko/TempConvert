# TempConvert
Another C project I did myself to practice C programming.
This one only accepts input as an argument when running.

# Compiling
To compile, use gcc and do:

`gcc -ansi a.c`

# Running
If you want to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, add 'f' as the 2nd argument:

`./program 32 f`

To do the opposite (Fahrenheit to Celsius), do:

`./program -17.77778 c`

Once again, thanks to [Francesco149](https://github.com/Francesco149/) for teaching me some things.
